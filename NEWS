Changes Version 0.0.7
  o A bug was fixed that did not check properly the number of predictable observations when the lag number
  was larger than 1 and a Day argument was specified
  o The function numberPredictableObservations() shows the output now also per subject in addition to the total number of predictable observations
  o A bug was fixed within the checkPoseteriorsNA() function, when resetting of values had to be performed, this reset was not properly passed to the function that determines convergence (to indicate that this solution did not converge).
